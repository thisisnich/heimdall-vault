## Questions

**1. What is an embedded system?**
- A. Processor-based system with HW+SW designed to perform *generic* tasks with limited resources.
- B. Processor-based system with HW only, designed to perform *specific* tasks with limited resources.
- C. Processor-based system with HW+SW designed to perform specific tasks with *unlimited* resources.
- D. Processor-based system with HW+SW designed to perform specific tasks with limited resources.

> ✅ **Answer: D**

---

**2. Which of the following is NOT a peripheral in the processor?**
- A. `GPIO`
- B. `ADC`
- C. Connector
- D. `SPI`

> ✅ **Answer: C** — A Connector is a physical interface component, not an on-chip peripheral.

---

**3. What is the MAIN role of a processor in an embedded system?**
- A. Stores data and program.
- B. Communicates with another processor.
- C. Processes data and instructions.
- D. Captures and converts sensor data.

> ✅ **Answer: C**

---

**4. Which of the following is a type of processor?**
- A. `PWM` and Comparator
- B. **MPU** and **MCU**
- C. `ADC` and `DAC`
- D. `SPI` and `I2C`

> ✅ **Answer: B** — MPU (Microprocessor Unit) and MCU (Microcontroller Unit) are processor types. The others are peripherals.

---

**5. Which of the following is NOT supposed to be connected to a digital input of a microcontroller?**
- A. Switch
- B. Push button
- C. Digital output of a sensor
- D. LED

> ✅ **Answer: D** — An LED is an output device; it should be connected to a digital *output*, not an input.

---

**6. Which peripheral is commonly used to generate audible tones through a buzzer?**
- A. `ADC`
- B. Comparator
- C. `PWM`
- D. `GPIO`

> ✅ **Answer: C** — PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) generates variable-frequency signals used to drive buzzers.

---

**7. Which of the following is NOT a serial interface?**  (this on i didnt know)
- A. `UART`
- B. `ADC`
- C. `SPI`
- D. `I2C`

> ✅ **Answer: B** — ADC is a signal conversion peripheral, not a serial communication interface.

---

**8. Which peripheral CAN be used to provide accurate clock timing to the processor?**
- A. `GPIO`
- B. `ADC`
- C. Real Time Clock (`RTC`)
- D. `UART`

> ✅ **Answer: C**
> -> RTC is usually external, but can be internal/embedded.  e.g. RTC on mobo -> battery supplies it seperately



---

**9. What is the purpose of a debug probe in embedded system development?**
- A. To probe, trace and control the target processor.
- B. To convert assembly language into a pattern of bits.
- C. To link one or more object files into a single executable file.
- D. To translate a high-level programming language to a lower level language.

> ✅ **Answer: A**

---

**10. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) comprises the following EXCEPT:**
- A. Editor
- B. Assembler
- C. Compiler
- D. Calculator

> ✅ **Answer: D** — An IDE contains an editor, assembler, compiler, and debugger — not a calculator.
